# Release script for the Antigravity SDK.
#
# Builds platform-specific wheels containing the pre-compiled Go
# localharness binary and uploads them to the OSS Exit Gate for
# distribution.
#
# This script works in two modes:
#   1. Kokoro: Runs inside a Kokoro release job. Binaries are fetched
#      from MPM via Kokoro's fetch_mpm (pre-populated by Rapid).
#   2. Local: Run from a Copybara export directory after manually
#      placing binaries under .kokoro/binaries/<platform>/localharness.
#
# Environment variables:
#   VERSION         - SDK version (default: auto-read from pyproject.toml).
#
# Usage (local, after Copybara export):
#   # Place binary(ies) under .kokoro/binaries/<platform>/localharness,
#   # then run:
#   VERSION=0.1.1 .kokoro/release.sh
#
# Usage (single platform, local shortcut):
#   mkdir -p .kokoro/binaries/linux-x86_64
#   cp /path/to/localharness .kokoro/binaries/linux-x86_64/localharness
#   .kokoro/release.sh
